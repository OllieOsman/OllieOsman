# Hi, I'm Ali 👋

I build software systems to understand how they **behave under stress** and how they **fail in the real world**.

Most of my work here is not about frameworks — it's about:
- tradeoffs
- failure modes
- testability
- observability
- and the uncomfortable edges of distributed systems

I’m especially interested in:
- resilient service design
- async & concurrency in .NET
- testing non-deterministic behavior
- feature flags & runtime configuration
- operational concerns (deployments, rollbacks, shutdowns)

### What you’ll find here
- Opinionated reference implementations
- Small systems built “as if they’ll run in prod”
- Experiments that answer *one hard question at a time*
- READMEs that explain **why**, not just **how**

### What you won’t find
- Tutorial clones
- Framework bingo
- Shallow demo apps

If something here looks unfinished, it probably is — intentionally.
I prefer evolving systems over polished demos.
